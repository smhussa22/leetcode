My solutions to LeetCode problems, currently written only in **Java**.

Each problem is implemented in its own class with a `main` method, allowing solutions to be compiled and run locally outside of LeetCode.

## Running Solutions

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```
.\run.ps1 AddTwoNumbers
.\run.ps1 TwoSum
```

**macOS / Linux / WSL:**
```
make AddTwoNumbers
make TwoSum
```

The class name must match the Java file name (e.g. `AddTwoNumbers.java` \u2192 `class AddTwoNumbers`).
